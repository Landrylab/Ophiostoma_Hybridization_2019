### Scripts for estimating and handling diversity data




### Getting Dxy per window estimates

combineDxy.py
'''
The script reads ouput of calcDxy.R script (ngsTools) with dxy estimated per site.
As a second input it reads ANGSD output with Fst estimated in windows.
For a given size of windows it sums dxy for positions within a window
and divides by the number of positions in the window estimated by ANGSD in Fst output.
If number of sites is less than 50% of a window length, window is not printed.
The script will read Fst file only if it was calculated for the same window size starting at position 1.
'''

USAGE:
    
python combineDxy.py
requirements:
<ame1_ame2>.Dxy_persite.txt
<ame1.ame2>.fst.window

output:
<ame1.ame2>_window_Dxy.txt




### Converting genotypes into major-minor allele

convert2MajorMinor.py
'''
This script reads a table with SNPs with chromosome, position, allele frequency (AF) 
and genotype coded as 0, 1 or ./. for missing data. 
According to AF it converts the genotype to F (frequent - major allele), R (rare - minor allele).
'''

USAGE:

python convertMajor2Minor.py

requirements:
genotypes1.tab

output: 
convert2MajorMinor.tab




### Plottig heatmap of genotypes

plotGenotypesHeatMap.R
'''
Script reads a table with SNPs and genotypes for multiple samples,
plots a heatmap with genotypes and performs clustering with hclust.
It also reads a file with sample names in the same order as they appear in the table.
'''

requirements:
convert2MajorMinor.tab
strains_vcf_order.txt

output:
plotGenotypesHeatmap.pdf
strains_hclust_order.txt




### Plotting distribution of diversity in 50 kb windows

plotDiversityDist.R
'''
Script reads files with estimates of nucleotide diversity in 50 kb windows 
and plots distribution of estimates for each lineage
'''

requirements:
Windows_Statistics.txt




### Plotting diversity/divergence correlations

calculateCorrelations.R
'''
Script reads table with estimates of diversity (Pi) and divergence (Dxy and Fst),
calculates and plots correlations
'''

requirements:
Windows_Statistics.txt
