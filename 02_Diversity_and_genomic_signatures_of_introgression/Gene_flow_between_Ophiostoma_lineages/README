### Estimating D-statistic

runUnbiasedD_Outgr.py
'''
This scipt reads vcf with SNPs, genome in fasta file with ancestral state,
and a file with population info, and calculates unbiased D (Patterson's D) 
for different combinations of 4 taxa
'''


USAGE:

python runUnbiasedD_Outgr.py

requirements:
sample.recode.vcf			# sample vcf file
Species_distinction_PCA.txt		# population info
himalH327_HP30_OphioH327chr_1.fasta	# example fasta file with an outgroup
