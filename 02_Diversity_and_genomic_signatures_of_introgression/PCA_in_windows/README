'''
Script reads file with genotypes for a window/region, table with population information, file with list of samples,
and order of labels, carries out a PCA analysis and determines a distance of each strain from ULM
'''

OphioH327chr_1_0a.raw		# genotypes for all strains for a window/region
Species_distinction_PCA.txt	# population info
plotLabelOrder_2.txt		# order of labels
Raw_label			# strain names
