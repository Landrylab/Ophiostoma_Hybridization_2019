### Scripts for detecting high diversity regions across the genome


bootstrapPi.py
'''
This script reads a table with per site estimates of Pi, performs reshuffling 
of all positions in the genome and recalulates Pi for each window;
after x times, 95th and 99th percentile of bootstrapped Pi distribution is obtained
'''

USAGE:
    
python bootstrapPi.py

requirements:
sample_table_tP_persite.txt 	# a sample table with per-site estimates of Pi across the whole genome

output:
bootstrapPi.out
